* Transdux

Managing React Component state in *Elegant & Functional* way with transducers and channels from ClojureScript

** Rational
flux and redux are great and solve state management and communication pretty well.

*But* they are too complicated, users have to know to many things about store, dispatcher, actions which they shouldn't

In reality what we have to do is actually just need to *talk* to *whatever* component I like and get my state just from *source of truth*
- defining a action will create a tunnel for a component, so other component can talk to you via the tunnel. 
- your new state is always come from tunnels
- your actions(what you can do) define what kind of tunnel you have.

For component who has *actions*, only thing it have to define is what can it do

For component who want to call other component's action, it directly *dispatch* a message to that component.

SO, all user have to know is define *actions* and *dispatch* messages.

*The Big Picture*

** Install
In your React project
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
npm install transdux --save
#+END_SRC
** Usage
*** 1. wrap you app with Transdux
#+BEGIN_SRC html
  <Transdux>
      <App/>
  </Transdux>
#+END_SRC
*** 2. define what your component can do
#+BEGIN_SRC js
// MainSection.jsx
let actions = {
  complete(msg, state){
    return {
      todos:state.todos.map(todo=>{
        if(todo.id==msg.id)
          todo.completed = !todo.completed
        return todo
      })
    }
  },
  clear(msg,state){
    return {
      todos: state.todos.filter(todo=>todo.completed==false)
    }
  }
}
#+END_SRC
*** 3. mixin Transdux Mixin and Bind Actions
#+BEGIN_SRC js
// MainSection.jsx
  import {TxMixin} from 'transdux'
  let MainSection = React.createClass({
    mixins: [TxMixin],
    componentDidMount(){
      this.bindActions(actions)
    },
    ...
  })

#+END_SRC

*** 4. dispatch a message
#+BEGIN_SRC jsx
  //TodoItem.jsx
  import MainSection from './MainSection'
  let TodoItem = React.createClass({
      mixins: [TxMixin],
      render(){
          <input className="toggle"
              type="checkbox"
              checked={todo.completed}
              onChange={() => this.dispatch(MainSection, 'complete',{id:todo.id})} />

      }
  })
#+END_SRC
